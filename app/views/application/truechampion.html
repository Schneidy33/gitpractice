Soon after he was born, his parents moved the family to Wilmington, North Carolina. Michael excelled at sports from an early age. Although he was cut from the Laney High School varsity basketball team his sophomore year in high school, he grew four inches over the summer and averaged 25 points per game as a junior. During his senior year, he became the only player in high school basketball history to average a triple-double (at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists per game). That year, 1982, he was named a McDonaldâ€™s High School All-American and received a scholarship to play basketball at the University of North Carolina. <p>Michael quickly became a star under the tutelage of North Carolina head basketball coach Dean Smith. During his freshman year, he hit the game winning shot against Georgetown University that resulted in a national championship. As a senior, he earned the Naismith award as the top basketball player in college basketball. After his junior year, Jordan decided to leave North Carolina to enter the NBA draft.</p></p></div>
